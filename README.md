> A multi-state, consumer-friendly directory and educational resource for Direct Primary Care.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To provide a scalable, high-trust platform that connects patients with Direct Primary Care (DPC) providers, starting with a regional focus and expanding nationwide. The platform emphasizes transparency, HSA compliance visibility, and a "Medical-Modern" aesthetic.

## 📂 Project Structure
This project follows the **Anti-Gravity** workspace standard:
* `data/` — JSON-driven architecture for state-specific clinic data (e.g., `mi-clinics.json`).
* `docs/` — Planning, architecture, and keyword lists.
* `execution/` — Automation scripts and deterministic actions.
* `directives/` — Project-specific SOPs and guidance.
* `.tmp/` — Temporary agent artifacts (Git-ignored).

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Modular Data Strategy**: State-specific JSON data files allow for easy scaling without architectural changes.
* **HSA Compliance Logic**: Automated verification of pricing thresholds to display "HSA-Compliant" badges.
* **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for one-handed navigation and responsive grid layouts.

## 🛡️ Content & SEO Boundary
This project adheres to strict SEO/GEO content preservation rules. Marketing copy and keyword-optimized text blocks are immutable assets and must not be modified during code refactoring without explicit intent.
