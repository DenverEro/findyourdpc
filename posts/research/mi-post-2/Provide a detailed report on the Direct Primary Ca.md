# Provide a detailed report on the Direct Primary Care (DPC) landscape in Michigan for 2026. I need the current number of active DPC practices in the state, any recent Michigan-specific legislative changes affecting DPC, and the estimated patient growth rate since the 2026 HSA-compatibility laws went into effect.

Based on my comprehensive research, I now have sufficient information to provide a detailed report addressing the user's query about the Michigan DPC landscape.

***

## The Direct Primary Care Landscape in Michigan for 2026

### Executive Summary

Michigan's Direct Primary Care market remains nascent but is positioned for growth following the January 1, 2026 federal HSA compatibility changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The state currently has a small but established DPC presence, foundational regulatory protections established in 2015, and emerging employer interest driven by federal policy shifts. However, specific quantitative data on current practice counts and patient growth rates post-HSA implementation remains limited, indicating this market segment is still transitioning from niche to mainstream adoption.

### Current DPC Practice Presence in Michigan

**Practice Count.** Quantifying active DPC practices in Michigan as of January 2026 is challenging due to lack of public state-level data aggregation. The most recent specific Michigan count comes from 2017, when Plum Health DPC identified approximately 8 DPC providers in the state, of which only 2 were classified as "pure" authentic Direct Primary Care practices:[^1]

- **Plum Health DPC** (Detroit) — established practice serving Southwest Detroit
- **YourChoice by Chad Savage, MD** (Brighton) — family medicine practice

An additional number of "hybrid" practices operate DPC alongside traditional insurance-based care, including providers in Dearborn, Grand Blanc, and Saginaw, though these practices maintain dual revenue models that limit their alignment with the DPC model's core principle of singular fee-for-service arrangement.[^1]

**National Context for Michigan Growth.** While Michigan-specific 2026 enrollment data is unavailable, the national DPC landscape provides context for potential Michigan expansion. As of January 2026, the United States has approximately 2,878 active DPC practices, serving 1.4 million members—representing 135% growth in practice count and 180% growth in membership since 2020. This national surge follows the HSA compatibility changes, suggesting Michigan practices and employers may experience similar acceleration as awareness expands.[^2]

### Michigan Regulatory Framework for DPC

**Existing Legislation.** Michigan established foundational legal protections for DPC arrangements in 2015 with Senate Bill 1033, signed into law January 10, 2015. The law, now codified in Michigan Compiled Laws § 500.129 ("Medical Retainer Agreement Not Subject to Act"), explicitly excludes properly structured medical retainer agreements from Michigan's Insurance Code.[^3][^4]

To qualify for this exemption, a medical retainer agreement must:[^4]

- Be in writing and signed by both provider and patient/legal representative
- Allow either party to terminate with written notice
- Describe and quantify specific routine healthcare services included
- Specify the fee and time period covered
- Prominently state in writing that the agreement is not health insurance
- Prohibit provider and patient from billing insurers or third parties for included services
- Prominently disclose that patients must pay out-of-pocket for non-covered services

This statute provides legal certainty that DPC arrangements will not face "business of insurance" regulatory challenges—a critical issue for practitioners transitioning from traditional insurance-based models. However, the law's language does not distinguish between DPC and concierge medicine, instead treating both as "retainer" arrangements.[^3]

**Medicaid DPC Pilot Program.** Michigan implemented a Medicaid DPC Primary Care Pilot Program, with quarterly reports and a November 2018 status report documenting the pilot's progression. Current status of this program as of 2026 is not publicly detailed in available sources.[^3]

### Federal Policy Catalyst: OBBBA HSA Compatibility (Effective January 1, 2026)

The January 1, 2026 effective date of OBBBA provisions fundamentally changes DPC economics for Michigan patients and employers. Effective for 2026 and beyond:[^5][^6]

**Fee Limits (Annually Indexed for Inflation):**

- Individual coverage: \$150/month (\$1,800/year)
- Family coverage: \$300/month (\$3,600/year)

**Tax Treatment.** DPC membership fees are now classified as qualified medical expenses under IRC Section 213(d) and can be paid with pre-tax HSA funds without disqualifying individuals from making HSA contributions. Critically, DPCSA fees do not count toward High Deductible Health Plan annual deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums, allowing full stacking of savings.[^6][^5]

This policy shift directly addresses one of the major historical barriers to DPC adoption: HSA compatibility. Nationally, DPC organizations report this development as transformational for employer and employee adoption, particularly among small and mid-sized employers seeking to control healthcare costs.[^5]

### Michigan-Specific Impacts and Growth Drivers

**Employer Adoption Momentum.** For 2026, employer-sponsored DPC is identified as a "core growth channel" nationally, with emphasis on employer readiness for onboarding, eligibility management, and reporting. In Michigan, the state's health insurance premium surge provides economic incentive: individual marketplace premiums in Michigan are projected to increase by up to 17%, and small business premiums by 11%, as a result of ACA subsidy changes in OBBBA. This affordability crisis is expected to drive employer interest in alternative care delivery models like DPC.[^7][^8][^5]

**Enrollment Instability Context.** Conversely, Michigan faces estimated losses of approximately 200,000 health insurance enrollees due to OBBBA provisions affecting Medicaid expansion and ACA marketplace subsidies. This coverage volatility may slow initial DPC adoption among lower-income populations while accelerating adoption among higher-income, self-insured populations and employers with mature benefits administration capacity.[^9]

**Healthcare System Strain.** Michigan's healthcare infrastructure faces pressure from federal Medicaid cuts that OBBBA attempts to limit through state budget action. The Michigan Legislature passed FY 2026 budget protections preserving \$2.7 billion in Medicaid funding, stabilizing hospital operations but creating limited surplus capacity for DPC integration within large health systems.[^10]

### Patient Growth Rate Since HSA Compatibility Implementation

**Available Data Limitations.** Specific Michigan patient enrollment growth statistics since January 1, 2026 are not publicly available. The HSA for America 2026 Michigan guide acknowledges that "the number of DPCs in Michigan is currently small, it will continue to grow as people embrace this option," but provides no quantified projections.[^11]

**National Leading Indicators.** National data suggests accelerated adoption post-HSA implementation. DPC News reported that early 2026 memberships surpassed 1.4 million nationally, with over 2,800 practices operating. However, this represents aggregate U.S. growth; Michigan-specific metrics are not separately tracked in public databases.[^2]

**Projected Growth Catalysts for Michigan.**

1. **Employer Awareness.** Employers in Michigan are increasingly familiar with DPC as a benefit offering, with growing educational resources available (notably, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act itself has become a catalyst for employer education on HSA-DPC pairing).[^5]
2. **Cost-Containment Imperative.** Michigan employers facing 17% individual insurance premium increases and 11% small business increases have acute motivation to evaluate alternative models.[^7]
3. **Provider Supply Constraints.** The limiting factor to DPC expansion nationally is physician supply, not patient demand. Michigan's physician workforce stress, with MSMS emphasizing physician burnout as a critical legislative priority in 2025, suggests some capacity for high-autonomy DPC transitions.[^12][^2]

### Market Maturation Indicators

**Operational Sophistication.** The DPC ecosystem in 2026 is characterized by mature infrastructure: purpose-built EHR platforms, established membership platforms, and standardized employer onboarding processes. Michigan practices can now launch with significantly lower implementation risk than the ecosystem pioneers navigating in 2015.[^5]

**Clarity on HSA Rules.** IRS Notice 2026-5 and subsequent guidance have provided explicit, actionable rules for DPCSA structuring, reducing legal uncertainty compared to the pre-2026 period when HSA compatibility was ambiguous.[^13][^5]

### Gaps and Limitations in Current Data

Critical quantitative gaps impede comprehensive market assessment:

1. **Michigan practice census**: No publicly available source lists active DPC practices in Michigan as of February 2026
2. **Patient enrollment by county**: Michigan Department of Health and Human Services does not publish DPC enrollment statistics
3. **Employer adoption rate**: Michigan lacks data on percentage of employers offering DPC benefits
4. **Growth trajectory validation**: Post-January 1, 2026 patient enrollment acceleration cannot be quantified from available public sources

These gaps suggest either (1) DPC adoption remains below threshold for public health surveillance tracking, or (2) data exists but is not aggregated at the state level.

### Conclusion

Michigan's DPC landscape in 2026 is characterized by regulatory foundation, modest but growing provider presence, and a significant federal policy tailwind from HSA compatibility changes. The state has 10+ years of legal certainty supporting DPC practice, eliminating a critical barrier that existed in earlier-adopter states. However, the market remains nascent with only a handful of pure DPC practices, limited public data on adoption metrics, and growth constrained primarily by physician supply rather than patient demand. The pronounced healthcare affordability crisis Michigan is experiencing positions DPC as an increasingly attractive option for both employers and patients, suggesting acceleration is probable in 2026-2027, but this acceleration cannot yet be quantified with available data sources.[^11][^1][^2]
