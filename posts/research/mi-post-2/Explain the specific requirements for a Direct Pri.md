# Explain the specific requirements for a Direct Primary Care (DPC) arrangement to be considered a 'qualified medical expense' under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025. Specifically, list the 2026 monthly fee caps for individuals and families, and clarify what services (like anesthesia or specialty labs) must be excluded to maintain HSA compatibility according to IRS Notice 2026-5.

## Direct Primary Care Requirements Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025

### Overview

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), enacted July 4, 2025, fundamentally transformed the relationship between Direct Primary Care (DPC) arrangements and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) by explicitly carving out qualifying DPC arrangements from the definition of disqualifying health coverage. IRS Notice 2026-5, issued in December 2025, provides definitive guidance on how these arrangements must be structured to maintain HSA compatibility and be treated as qualified medical expenses.

### 2026 Monthly Fee Caps

To qualify as a Direct Primary Care Service Arrangement (DPCSA) under the new rules and maintain HSA eligibility, the arrangement must not exceed the following monthly aggregate fee limits:[^1][^2][^3]


| Coverage Type | 2026 Monthly Cap | Annual Equivalent |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Individual (single person) | \$150 | \$1,800 |
| Family or More Than One Individual | \$300 | \$3,600 |

These limits apply to the aggregate of all DPC arrangements for a single individual. The caps are adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2027.[^4]

The statute permits billing flexibility—fees can be charged for periods longer than one month (up to a year) provided the aggregate fees remain fixed, periodic, and do not exceed the monthly limit on an annualized basis. For example, a 2026 individual arrangement could be billed as \$1,800 annually, \$900 semi-annually, or \$450 quarterly.[^3][^4]

### Services That Must Be Excluded

Under IRS Notice 2026-5, the following services and items must be excluded from DPC coverage to maintain HSA compatibility and qualified medical expense status. Any arrangement including these services either loses its DPCSA treatment or disqualifies the individual from making HSA contributions:[^5][^4]

**1. Procedures Requiring General Anesthesia**

Surgical procedures or diagnostic interventions requiring general anesthesia cannot be included in the DPC membership fee. This explicitly excludes operative procedures requiring anesthetic administration—for example, endoscopy requiring sedation would typically fall outside the scope.[^4]

**2. Prescription Drugs (Except Vaccines)**

Prescription medications are categorically excluded from primary care services covered under a DPC arrangement, with one critical exception: vaccines are explicitly permitted. This distinction allows immunizations and vaccinations to be included in the fixed periodic fee while requiring separate billing for non-vaccine pharmaceuticals.[^6][^7][^4]

**3. Laboratory Services Not Typically Administered in Ambulatory Primary Care Settings**

The regulation specifically excludes laboratory services that are not "typically administered in an ambulatory primary care setting." This distinction is important: routine diagnostic testing performed in a standard primary care office (such as basic blood draws, urinalysis, or common screening tests) may be included, but specialized, complex, or send-out laboratory work that requires external processing or specialized facilities must be excluded.[^5][^4]

The IRS Notice clarifies that basic diagnostic procedures performed within the primary care setting are permitted; the exclusion applies only to laboratory services requiring facilities or expertise beyond what a primary care practice typically provides.[^4]

### Core Structural Requirements for DPCSA Qualification

Beyond fee limitations and service exclusions, a DPC arrangement must meet four structural requirements to qualify as a DPCSA and avoid disqualifying individuals from HSA contributions:[^4]

**Eligible Providers.** Services must be provided exclusively by qualified primary care practitioners, defined as:

- Physicians with primary specialty designation in family medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric medicine
- Nurse practitioners
- Clinical nurse specialists
- Physician assistants

**Sole Compensation Mechanism.** The sole compensation for care within the arrangement must be the fixed periodic fee. The arrangement cannot bill separately for services that are included in the membership, through insurance or other means. However, providers may offer additional services outside the DPCSA and bill both members and non-members for those services without affecting the DPCSA's qualification status.[^4]

**Primary Care Services Only.** The arrangement must provide medical care consisting solely of primary care services. Whether an arrangement qualifies depends on the explicit terms of the arrangement, not on which services individual members actually use. If an arrangement offers services beyond primary care, an individual cannot selectively use only primary care services and claim DPCSA treatment.[^4]

**Medical Care Scope.** Services must constitute "medical care" as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 213(d), encompassing care for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease affecting body structure or function.

### Treatment as Qualified Medical Expense

Under Section 71308 of the OBBBA and IRS Notice 2026-5, qualifying DPCSA fees are treated as qualified medical expenses and may be reimbursed on a tax-free basis from HSA funds. HSAs may treat DPCSA expenses as incurred on (1) the first day of each month of coverage on a pro rata basis, (2) the first day of the coverage period, or (3) the date fees are paid, allowing immediate reimbursement for annual prepayments.[^1][^3][^4]

Critically, DPCSA fees paid by an individual do not count toward the High Deductible Health Plan's (HDHP) annual deductible or out-of-pocket maximum, since they are not payments for services covered by the HDHP.[^4]

### Fee Limitation Trade-Offs

An important distinction exists between the eligibility threshold and the reimbursement eligibility. If a DPCSA's fees exceed the monthly cap (\$150 individual/\$300 family), individuals face a trade-off:[^3]

- **HSA funds may still be used** to reimburse the excess DPCSA fees
- **But individuals cannot make new HSA contributions** while enrolled in that arrangement

This flexibility allows individuals to enroll in arrangements exceeding the caps while understanding the HSA contribution implications.

### Effective Date and Implementation

All provisions relating to DPCSAs apply to months beginning after December 31, 2025, making them fully effective for 2026. The IRS is accepting public comments through March 6, 2026, on all aspects of Notice 2026-5, indicating that additional clarifying guidance may be issued.[^1][^4]
