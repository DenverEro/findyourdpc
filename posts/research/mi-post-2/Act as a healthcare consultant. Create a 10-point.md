# Act as a healthcare consultant. Create a 10-point compliance checklist for a Michigan DPC doctor who wants to market themselves as 'HSA-Eligible' in 2026. Focus on contract language, billing frequency (arrears vs. advance), fee structures, and the required 'Non-Insurance' disclaimers under federal law.

Now I have all the information I need to create a comprehensive 10-point compliance checklist. Let me generate the final report.

***

## Healthcare Compliance Checklist: Direct Primary Care HSA-Eligible Arrangement

## For Michigan Physicians (2026)

A Michigan Direct Primary Care (DPC) practice marketing itself as "HSA-Eligible" under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act must comply with overlapping federal tax requirements (IRS Notice 2026-5), Michigan state law (Medical Retainer Agreement statute), and HSA structural rules. This 10-point compliance checklist addresses the critical requirements that distinguish a qualifying Direct Primary Care Service Arrangement (DPCSA) from arrangements that disqualify members from HSA contributions or violate Michigan insurance law.

***

### 1. **Establish Monthly Fee Caps and Document Compliance**

**Requirement:** OBBBA limits DPCSA fees to \$150/month for individual coverage and \$300/month for family coverage (indexed annually). Aggregate fees across all DPC arrangements for a single individual cannot exceed these limits.[^1][^2]

**Implementation:**

- Confirm your fee structure does not exceed: \$150/individual or \$300/family per month
- If offering different family tiers (single, couple, family), ensure largest plan is ≤ \$300/month
- Document fee structure in writing with: specific monthly amount, billing frequency, renewal terms
- If billing less frequently (quarterly, annual), confirm aggregate amount divided by months stays within limits
    - Example: \$450 quarterly = \$150/month average ✓
    - Example: \$400 quarterly = \$133/month average ✓
- Create a policy document titled "2026 Fee Structure Compliance" stating your fees comply with IRS Notice 2026-5
- For all marketing materials claiming "HSA-Eligible," include: "This arrangement complies with 2026 IRS Notice 2026-5 limitations: \$150/month individual, \$300/month family"[^3][^2]

**Documentation to retain:** Fee schedule, written policy confirming compliance, email notification to all current members if fees changed for 2026 compliance.

***

### 2. **Clearly Delineate Included Services and Exclude Anesthesia/Specialty Labs/Prescription Drugs**

**Requirement:** DPCSA must provide ONLY primary care services. Three categories of services are explicitly excluded and cannot be offered as part of the membership fee:[^4][^1]

- Procedures requiring general anesthesia
- Prescription drugs (except vaccines)
- Laboratory services not typically administered in ambulatory primary care

**Implementation:**

- Create a written "Covered Services List" explicitly defining services included in monthly membership fee:
    - Acceptable examples: unlimited office visits, basic consultations, routine health maintenance, preventive care screenings, simple wound care, basic lab draws (urinalysis, glucose testing), basic EKG, established chronic disease management
- Create a separate "Non-Covered Services and Separate Fees" list explicitly excluding:
    - "Procedures requiring general anesthesia or sedation are NOT included and will be billed separately"
    - "Prescription medications (except vaccines) are NOT included; patients pay pharmacy directly or we bill separately"
    - "Advanced laboratory services, imaging, pathology, and specialty testing are NOT included; separate billing will apply"
    - "Specialist referrals, surgical procedures, and hospital care are NOT included"
- In your member agreement, state: "THIS MEMBERSHIP COVERS PRIMARY CARE SERVICES ONLY. Services listed above are NOT included and remain the member's responsibility to arrange and pay for directly."
- Train billing staff to identify and segregate charges:
    - If member has lab drawn in office (basic), charge to membership
    - If member needs advanced lab sent to reference lab, charge separately with notice: "This lab service exceeds primary care scope and is billed separately"
- For prescription drugs: "Our office does not dispense prescription medications as part of membership. All prescription medications must be filled at a pharmacy and paid for by the patient."
    - Exception: Vaccines are included if relevant to your practice[^1]

**Documentation to retain:** Covered/non-covered services list (dated and signed by you and staff), member agreement with these lists, billing records showing segregation of DPCSA vs. separately-billed items, examples of separate bills issued.

***

### 3. **Draft a Compliant Member Agreement Incorporating Michigan Statutory Language**

**Requirement:** Michigan MCL 500.129 requires medical retainer agreements to include specific language to qualify for non-insurance exemption. Federal OBBBA adds additional requirements that must appear in the contract.[^5][^6][^4][^1]

**Implementation:**

- Write your member agreement to include ALL of the following elements:

**Section 1: Identification**

- Provider/practice name, location, and credentials (MD/DO license number)
- Member name, date of birth, enrollment effective date
- Term: Monthly/Quarterly/Annual (specify)

**Section 2: Services Covered (detailed list)**

- Unlimited office visits for established conditions
- Preventive health screenings
- Chronic disease management
- Basic consultation and counseling
- [Any other primary care services specific to your scope]

**Section 3: Services NOT Covered (detailed list)**

- All procedures requiring general anesthesia
- All prescription medications except vaccines
- Advanced laboratory services and imaging
- Specialist consultations and referrals
- Surgical procedures
- Hospital inpatient care

**Section 4: Fee and Payment Terms**

- "Monthly membership fee: \$[amount] per month"
- "Billing method: [auto-pay on [date] via credit card/ACH]"
- "First month fee due upon enrollment"
- "Subsequent months due on [date]"
- "Billing frequency: Monthly/Quarterly/Annual"
- "Payment terms: Due within [X] days of invoice"

**Section 5: Termination Rights**

- "Either party may terminate this agreement at any time with written notice"
- "Termination effective date: [specify if end of month or immediate]"
- "If terminated mid-month, member is responsible for [pro-rata/monthly] fee"
- "Provider provides [X] days notice before terminating member relationship"

**Section 6: MANDATORY NON-INSURANCE DISCLAIMER (Michigan MCL 500.129 Required Language)**

- Place this language in BOLD, ALL CAPS, or a separate box on first page:
> "THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT AN INSURANCE PLAN AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. THIS IS NOT INSURANCE COVERAGE. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING SEPARATE HEALTH INSURANCE. THIS MEMBERSHIP COVERS ONLY THE SPECIFIC SERVICES LISTED ABOVE. ALL OTHER MEDICAL EXPENSES, SERVICES, AND CARE NOT EXPLICITLY LISTED ARE YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY."

**Section 7: No Third-Party Billing Commitment (Michigan MCL 500.129 Required)**

- "Provider agrees NOT to bill any health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, or third-party payer for any services provided under this agreement."
- "Member agrees that this membership fee is the sole payment obligation to provider for covered services and that member is responsible for all non-covered services."

**Section 8: Federal Tax Compliance (IRS Notice 2026-5)**

- "This arrangement is structured to comply with IRS Notice 2026-5 and qualifies as a Direct Primary Care Service Arrangement (DPCSA)."
- "Member may use Health Savings Account (HSA) funds to pay this membership fee if member maintains HSA-eligible coverage."
- "This membership fee is treated as a qualified medical expense under IRC Section 213(d)."
- "This membership fee is NOT applied toward any HDHP deductible or out-of-pocket maximum."

**Section 9: Separately Billed Services Notice**

- "Provider may offer services outside this membership agreement (such as advanced labs, imaging, procedures, medications) and will separately bill member for such services."
- "Separate service billing shall be at provider's stated cash fees or negotiated rates."

**Section 10: HIPAA and Record Access**

- Standard HIPAA authorization language
- Patient's right to obtain copies of records
- Provider's data retention and security practices

**Section 11: Fee Increase Policy**

- "Provider reserves right to increase monthly fee with at least 90 days' written notice to member."
- "Fee increases will be effective on [date] or at end of current billing period, whichever is later."

**Section 12: Renewal**

- "This agreement renews automatically each [month/quarter/year] unless either party provides [X] days' notice of non-renewal."
- Have a healthcare attorney licensed in Michigan review this agreement before use[^6][^5]
- Provide signed copy to member at enrollment
- Maintain signed copy in patient's permanent record
- Update agreement annually to reflect current fees and any service changes

**Documentation to retain:** Final signed member agreement (template version and all individual member signatures), evidence of attorney review, dated record of when each member signed.

***

### 4. **Select Billing Frequency and Implement Billing-in-Arrears Structure**

**Requirement:** While OBBBA allows flexible billing periods (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual), Michigan state regulatory risk is minimized by billing "in arrears" (end of month) rather than in advance, because advance collection of periodic fees can be characterized as "insurance" under state insurance codes.[^7][^5]

**Implementation:**

- **Recommended structure: Billing in Arrears**
    - Bill at END of service month for services provided during that month
    - Example: August services billed on August 31 or early September
    - Payment due [within X days, e.g., by 15th of following month]
    - This structure is legally safer under Michigan MCL 500.129 because payment follows service delivery, not advance of service[^7]
- **Alternative: Billing in Advance with Enrollment Fee**
    - If you prefer advance monthly billing: First month billed upon enrollment, subsequent months billed on 1st of month
    - Consider collecting a separate ENROLLMENT/ADMINISTRATION FEE (not part of monthly fee) to establish upfront cash flow
    - Enrollment fee must be clearly separate from membership fee and disclosed separately
    - Example: "\$250 enrollment fee + \$120/month membership fee"
    - This combination is more defensible than pure advance billing[^7]
- **Frequency options (all compliant if within fee limits):**
    - Monthly: \$[X] per month, billed on [date]
    - Quarterly: \$[X] per quarter (billed for 3-month periods), averaging ≤ \$50/month
    - Semi-annual: \$[X] per 6 months, averaging ≤ \$50/month
    - Annual: \$[X] for 12 months, not exceeding \$1,800 individual or \$3,600 family[^2][^8]
- **Auto-payment setup:**
    - Require written authorization for auto-pay via credit card, debit card, or ACH
    - Retain signed authorization form
    - Provide member with clear disclosure of billing schedule before first charge
    - Send reminder before each billing cycle (30 days notice recommended)
- **Pro-ration policy for mid-month termination:**
    - "If member terminates mid-month, final fee is prorated to [termination date]: [calculation method]"
    - Example: "If member terminates on July 15, member owes 15/31 of monthly fee for July"
    - Document in membership agreement

**Documentation to retain:** Signed payment authorization forms, records showing billing dates and amounts, evidence of termination notices sent with pro-ration calculations, bank/credit card statements showing deposits.

***

### 5. **Ensure "Sole Compensation" Requirement: No Double-Billing for Membership Services**

**Requirement:** IRS Notice 2026-5 explicitly requires that "the sole compensation for care provided under a DPCSA must be the fixed periodic fee." This means you cannot charge an additional fee for ANY service explicitly included in the membership.[^9][^1]

**Implementation:**

- Create an internal billing rule: "Services explicitly listed in 'Covered Services' are compensated ONLY through monthly membership fee; no additional billing allowed."
- For each encounter, train staff to:
    - Check if service is on "Covered Services List"
    - If yes: Do NOT generate separate charge; count as part of membership
    - If no: Mark as "Non-Covered Service" and generate separate invoice with explanation
- Prohibited double-billing examples:
    - ❌ Cannot charge membership fee AND charge separate "\$35 office visit fee"
    - ❌ Cannot charge membership fee AND separately bill insurance for an office visit
    - ❌ Cannot charge membership fee AND require copay for routine visit
    - ✓ Correct: Membership fee covers routine visits; complex labs billed separately
- Permitted separate billing examples:
    - ✓ Membership covers primary care visit; advanced imaging billed separately with notice
    - ✓ Membership covers routine lab draw; reference lab processing billed separately
    - ✓ Membership covers established chronic disease management; specialist referral billed separately with notice
- Document your billing coding system:
    - Create CPT code mapping showing which codes are "membership-covered" vs. "separately billed"
    - Example: Office visits (99213-99215) = Membership covered
    - Example: Advanced imaging (71010 chest x-ray referral) = Billed separately
    - Provide this mapping to billing staff and EHR/billing system
- EHR/Billing System Configuration:
    - Configure your system so covered service codes do NOT generate invoices
    - Create separate code tracking for non-covered services that DO generate separate invoices
    - Audit monthly: Review all charges; confirm no "double charges" to membership members

**Documentation to retain:** Service-to-fee mapping document, billing audit records (monthly review showing segregation of charges), staff training materials on sole compensation rule, sample billing statements showing correct separation.

***

### 6. **Implement Separate Billing Process for Excluded Services**

**Requirement:** Services explicitly excluded from membership (anesthesia procedures, prescription drugs except vaccines, specialty labs) must be offered and billed separately to maintain DPCSA status. The ability to bill separately for these items is a feature of DPCSA, not a violation.[^10][^1]

**Implementation:**

- **Create separate billing workflows:**
    - Primary care office visit: Membership-covered, no charge
    - Patient needs prescription: Directed to pharmacy or provide script; patient pays pharmacy directly (not billed through practice)
    - Patient needs MRI: Generate estimate, provide explanation: "This imaging service is NOT included in membership. Cost: [estimate]. Please authorize before proceeding."
    - Patient needs lab that requires external processing: Generate separate bill: "This specialty lab is outside primary care scope. Separate charge applies. Cost: [amount]"
- **Separate service fee schedule:**
    - Create and publish a "Separate Services Fee Schedule" listing non-included services and cash fees
    - Example format:


| Service | Fee |
| :-- | :-- |
| Advanced Lab Panel (metabolic panel sent to reference lab) | \$[X] |
| EKG interpretation | \$[X] |
| Cerumen removal | \$[X] |
| Skin tag removal (if not primary care scope) | \$[X] |
| Simple suture removal | Covered |
| Complex wound closure | \$[X] |
| Vaccine administration | Covered |
| Vaccine (influenza) | \$[X] |

    - Make this schedule available to members in advance; discuss before service delivery if possible
    - Provide written notice before billing for unexpected separate charges
- **Notice requirements before billing:**
    - Before providing a non-covered service, inform patient: "This service is NOT included in your membership. Separate fee applies: \$[X]. Approve? [Yes/No]"
    - Document patient approval (verbal documented in chart, or written signature)
    - If patient declines, do not bill for service; document in chart
- **Payment collection for separate services:**
    - Can bill patient directly (not to insurance)
    - Can request payment at time of service ("Separate service charge: \$[X], due today")
    - Can invoice after service
    - Use separate invoice format clearly labeled: "NOT part of membership - Separate Service Charge"
- **Avoid commingling of revenues:**
    - Do not show membership fee and separate service charges on same invoice line
    - Use separate invoice documents or clearly separated sections
    - Track revenue separately in accounting (membership revenue vs. fee-for-service revenue)

**Documentation to retain:** Separate services fee schedule (dated, made available to members), sample separate service invoices, member authorization records for separately-billed services, chart notes documenting patient approval before service delivery.

***

### 7. **Create and Maintain "Non-Insurance" Disclaimer Package**

**Requirement:** Michigan MCL 500.129 requires the agreement to "prominently state" that the arrangement is not insurance. IRS Notice 2026-5 does not mandate specific disclaimer language but requires the arrangement to be structured so that it is NOT health insurance. Best practice is to provide multiple prominently-displayed disclaimers in different locations.[^11][^5][^6][^1]

**Implementation:**

- **Disclaimer \#1: Membership Agreement (Required by Michigan Law)**
    - Must appear on first page or in prominent box
    - Format: Bold, all caps, or separate highlighted section

> **THIS IS NOT INSURANCE**
>
> This Direct Primary Care Membership Agreement is NOT a health insurance plan and is NOT a substitute for health insurance. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining separate health insurance coverage through your employer, the individual marketplace, Medicaid, Medicare, or other source. This membership covers ONLY the specific primary care services listed in this agreement. All other medical services, prescriptions, specialist care, hospitalization, and emergency care are NOT covered and are your sole responsibility to pay for.
- **Disclaimer \#2: Patient Welcome Packet / Patient Portal**
    - Provide written disclaimer in welcome materials given at enrollment
    - Post on patient portal homepage
    - Provide verbally and in writing at first appointment

> **IMPORTANT: THIS MEMBERSHIP IS NOT INSURANCE**
>
> Your Direct Primary Care membership provides comprehensive primary care services for a fixed monthly fee. This is NOT health insurance. You MUST maintain separate health insurance to cover:
> - Specialist care
> - Prescription medications (except vaccines)
> - Hospitalization
> - Emergency room visits
> - Advanced testing and imaging
> - Surgical procedures
> - All other services not listed in your membership agreement
>
> If you do not have health insurance, you are responsible for paying out-of-pocket for all services outside this membership.
- **Disclaimer \#3: HSA-Specific Disclosure (Federal Compliance)**
    - If marketing as "HSA-Eligible," provide written disclosure:

> **HSA-ELIGIBLE MEMBERSHIP**
>
> This Direct Primary Care membership qualifies under IRS Notice 2026-5 as a Direct Primary Care Service Arrangement (DPCSA). If you have a High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) and Health Savings Account (HSA), you may use tax-free HSA funds to pay for this membership fee. This membership fee:
> - Is a qualified medical expense under IRC Section 213(d)
> - Does NOT apply toward your HDHP deductible
> - Does NOT apply toward your HDHP out-of-pocket maximum
> - Does NOT disqualify you from making HSA contributions
>
> Keep records of membership payments for HSA reimbursement purposes.
- **Disclaimer \#4: Website/Marketing Materials**
    - If advertising "HSA-Compatible DPC," include:

> "This Direct Primary Care practice offers memberships that comply with IRS Notice 2026-5 and qualify as HSA-Eligible. Membership fees are \$[X]/month and may be paid with tax-free HSA funds. This is NOT health insurance. You must maintain separate health insurance coverage."
- **Disclaimer \#5: Billing Statements/Invoices**
    - Include footer on all membership invoices:

> "This is a membership fee for Direct Primary Care services only, NOT an insurance premium. This membership is NOT health insurance and does NOT cover specialty care, prescriptions, hospitalization, or other services outside this agreement."
- **Disclaimer \#6: Insurance Billing Notice (Required by MCL 500.129)**
    - Include in agreement and all materials:

> "This practice does NOT bill any health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, or third-party payers for services provided under this membership agreement. Membership fees are the sole compensation. Members are responsible for all non-covered services."
- **Implementation in office:**
    - Post "NOT INSURANCE" sign in waiting room
    - Include disclaimer in new member packet
    - Have members sign acknowledgment that they received and understand non-insurance status
    - Train staff to verbally confirm member understanding: "This membership is NOT insurance; do you understand?"

**Documentation to retain:** Dated disclaimers, evidence of posting (photos of signs), member acknowledgment signatures, web screenshots showing disclaimer placement, marketing materials showing disclaimer inclusion.

***

### 8. **Implement Fee Increase Notice Protocol (90+ Days Advance Notice)**

**Requirement:** While OBBBA does not specify a notice period, best practice and contract terms typically require 90+ days' notice before increasing membership fees to maintain member trust and ensure compliance with "fixed" fee requirement.[^12][^5]

**Implementation:**

- **Written Policy:**
    - State in membership agreement: "Provider reserves right to increase membership fee with at least 90 days' written notice. Fee increases take effect on [date] or renewal date, whichever is later."
- **Fee increase notice process:**
    - Identify if and when fee increase will occur
    - Prepare written notice letter including:
        - Current fee: \$[X]/month
        - New fee: \$[X]/month (effective date)
        - Effective date (minimum 90 days from notice date)
        - Reason for increase (optional but recommended for member relations)
        - Member's right to terminate without penalty if they decline new fee
        - Clear statement: "No increase in fee applies to current billing period; increase takes effect [date]"
    - Deliver notice via:
        - Email with read receipt
        - Mail with return receipt
        - In-person at appointment
        - Patient portal notification
        - Document method of delivery
    - Verify all members received notice (maintain log)
    - Track which members terminate vs. accept new fee
    - Do not charge new fee until notice period expires
- **Important:** Do not frame fee increase as "insurance premium increase" (maintains non-insurance status)
    - ✓ Correct: "Membership fee increasing due to increased operational costs"
    - ❌ Incorrect: "Your insurance premium is changing"
- **Compliance check:**
    - After fee increase, confirm:
        - New fee still complies with \$150/\$300 monthly limits (if still marketing as HSA-eligible)
        - If new fee exceeds limit, must REMOVE "HSA-eligible" marketing and notify members of loss of HSA eligibility[^2]
        - Example: If raising individual membership from \$140 to \$155/month, it exceeds \$150 limit and no longer qualifies as DPCSA

**Documentation to retain:** Dated fee increase letters, delivery receipts, member acknowledgments of receipt, list of members who accepted vs. terminated, updated fee schedule reflecting implementation date.

***

### 9. **Verify "Primary Care Practitioners Only" Requirement and Document Provider Credentials**

**Requirement:** DPCSA must be provided ONLY by qualified primary care practitioners: physicians (MD/DO) with primary specialty in family medicine, internal medicine, geriatrics, or pediatrics, OR nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, or physician assistants.[^13][^4][^1]

**Implementation:**

- **Credential verification:**
    - Confirm your license/credentials align with DPCSA definition:
        - ✓ Family Medicine MD/DO
        - ✓ Internal Medicine MD/DO
        - ✓ Geriatric Medicine MD/DO
        - ✓ Pediatrics MD/DO
        - ✓ Nurse Practitioner (licensed in Michigan)
        - ✓ Clinical Nurse Specialist (licensed in Michigan)
        - ✓ Physician Assistant (licensed in Michigan)
        - ❌ Specialist MD (cardiology, orthopedics, dermatology) - NOT permitted as sole provider of DPCSA
        - ❌ Non-credentialed staff - NOT permitted
    - If you are a specialist: You cannot be the sole provider of the DPCSA; must partner with qualified primary care practitioner[^13]
- **Scope of services limitations:**
    - DPCSA primary care limitation: You can only provide services within your scope as primary care
    - Example: Family medicine doctor providing primary care = ✓
    - Example: Family medicine doctor providing DPC but also offering specialty orthopedic services within DPC = ❌ (violates primary care-only requirement)
    - If you want to offer specialty services: Must be outside DPCSA and billed separately
- **Team-based DPC:**
    - If your practice includes NPs or PAs: They can provide DPCSA services if they have primary care credentials
    - Document that supervising physician is primary care credentialed
    - Keep records of each provider's credentials on file
- **Documentation to retain:**
    - Current Michigan medical license(s)
    - Board certification documentation (if claimed)
    - License verification from Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA)
    - CV or credentials summary
    - Staff credentials (if team provides care)

***

### 10. **Establish Member Record Retention and HSA Reimbursement Documentation System**

**Requirement:** Members using HSA funds to pay DPCSA fees must retain documentation for tax purposes. Practices should maintain records to substantiate that arrangements comply with OBBBA requirements.[^8][^1][^2]

**Implementation:**

- **Documentation members need to keep for HSA reimbursement:**
    - Receipts or invoices showing membership fee paid
    - Membership agreement demonstrating services covered
    - Proof that they had HDHP/HSA coverage during period of payment
    - HSA administrator may require substantiation of expenses
    - Advise members: "Keep your membership invoices for [X] years in case of IRS audit"
- **Documentation your practice maintains:**
    - Signed member agreement (dated)
    - Fee schedules (effective dates)
    - Payment records (dates, amounts, member accounts)
    - Proof of service delivery (office visit dates, call logs)
    - Non-covered service charges (separately invoiced)
    - Billing records segregating DPCSA revenue from other revenue
    - Member termination records (with effective dates)
    - Fee increase notices and member acknowledgments
    - Member attestations of HSA coverage (if you collected them)
- **HSA member communication:**
    - At enrollment of HSA-eligible member, provide written statement:
> "Congratulations! Your Direct Primary Care membership qualifies as a Direct Primary Care Service Arrangement under IRS Notice 2026-5. You may use HSA funds to pay membership fees. For HSA reimbursement or deduction purposes, keep your membership invoices and receipts for [retention period per IRS guidance]."
    - Provide year-end summary letter to members:
> "2026 Membership Summary for HSA Purposes: Total fees paid: \$[X]. Services covered: [list]. This arrangement complies with IRS Notice 2026-5 DPCSA requirements."
- **Reimbursement timing flexibility (Important for HSA members):**
    - IRS allows DPCSA fees to be treated as incurred on: (1) first day of each month pro rata, (2) first day of coverage period, or (3) date paid
    - Example: Member pays annual fee of \$1,800 on December 15, 2025 for 2026 coverage = Can reimburse from 2026 HSA even though paid in 2025[^8][^2]
    - Advise members of these timing options to optimize HSA planning
- **Record retention timeline:**
    - Maintain membership records for minimum [state law requirement, typically 3-7 years]
    - Maintain financial/billing records per accounting standards (typically 5-7 years minimum)
    - For IRS audit defense: Retain indefinitely the core compliance documents (signed agreements, fee schedules, service descriptions, sole compensation policy)
- **System setup:**
    - If using EHR: Configure to track DPCSA members separately
    - If using accounting software: Create account codes segregating DPCSA revenue from other revenue
    - Create a folder/file labeled "DPCSA Compliance" containing:
        - Master copy of current agreement template
        - All signed individual member agreements
        - Fee schedules and amendments
        - HSA reimbursement guidance documents
        - IRS Notice 2026-5 (for reference)
        - Member HSA attestations (if collected)

**Documentation to retain:** Year-end summaries for HSA members, HSA reimbursement guidance documents provided to members, EHR/accounting system configuration showing DPCSA segregation, physical or digital file organization system.

## Final Recommendations

**Immediate Actions (Before Marketing as "HSA-Eligible"):**

1. Have a Michigan healthcare attorney review your membership agreement against current MCL 500.129 and IRS Notice 2026-5
2. Implement billing-in-arrears structure if currently billing in advance (lowest regulatory risk)
3. Create and post all required non-insurance disclaimers
4. Audit your member agreements to ensure all current members have signed compliant versions
5. Update your website and marketing to include HSA-specific compliance language

**Ongoing (Quarterly or Semi-Annual):**

1. Review membership fee structure for compliance with \$150/\$300 limits
2. Audit billing records to confirm no double-charging for membership services
3. Verify all new member agreements include current compliant language
4. Confirm all provider credentials remain active and aligned with primary care definition
5. Update disclaimers if IRS guidance changes

**Legal Review:**

- Have an attorney review this checklist against your specific practice circumstances
- Michigan healthcare law is complex; professional legal guidance is essential
- Consider annual compliance audit with healthcare counsel

***

**Critical Note for Marketing Claims:** Any advertisement claiming "HSA-Eligible" must be backed by documented compliance with all 10 points above.
