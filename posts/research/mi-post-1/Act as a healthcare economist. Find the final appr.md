# Act as a healthcare economist. Find the final approved 2026 premium rate changes for individual and small group health insurance plans in Michigan, focusing specifically on Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) and Priority Health. Extract the percentage increases and the number of lives affected. Also, find the estimated number of Michiganders who are projected to lose or have already left the ACA marketplace due to the expiration of federal enhanced premium tax credits. Provide results in a markdown table format with cited sources.

Perfect. I now have comprehensive data. Let me compile the final report with a markdown table as requested.

## 2026 Michigan Health Insurance Premium Rate Changes \& ACA Marketplace Enrollment Impact

### Executive Summary

Michigan's individual and small group health insurance markets experienced significant rate increases for 2026, with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) facing a 24.0% approved rate increase and Priority Health a 19.2% increase in the individual market. Concurrently, the expiration of federal enhanced premium tax credits precipitated a measurable decline in ACA marketplace enrollment, with an estimated 25,000 to 40,000 fewer Michiganders enrolling during the 2026 open enrollment period.

### Individual Market Rate Changes

The Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS) finalized 2026 premium rate approvals on October 28, 2025. For the individual market—which encompasses ACA marketplace plans and off-marketplace products—the data reveals stark disparities among major carriers:


| **Carrier** | **Approved Rate Increase** | **Current Enrollment** | **Plans with 15%+ Rate Hikes** | **Plans on Marketplace** |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan | 24.0%[^1] | 56,689[^1] | 10[^1] | 9[^1] |
| Priority Health | 19.2%[^1] | 121,940[^1] | 61[^1] | 48[^1] |
| Blue Care Network of Michigan | 23.3%[^1] | 96,738[^1] | 24[^1] | 20[^1] |
| United Healthcare Community Plan | 25.8%[^1] | 36,762[^1] | 13[^1] | 13[^1] |
| Oscar Insurance Company | 9.3%[^1] | 3,990[^1] | 1[^1] | 8[^1] |
| **Market Total** | **20.2%[^1]** | **532,645[^1]** | **137[^1]** | **116[^1]** |

BCBSM's 24.0% approved rate increase represents a significant deviation from its initial 18.2% request, reflecting revised risk adjustment projections and assumptions regarding enrollment composition changes. The carrier's filing explicitly acknowledged morbidity assumptions based on expected attrition of healthier, price-sensitive consumers following the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits. Priority Health's 19.2% approved rate—falling between its initial 14.4% request and its revised 22.7% refiling—reflects similar actuarial recalculations regarding risk pool deterioration.[^2][^1]

### Small Group Market Rate Changes

The small group market exhibited more moderate increases:


| **Carrier** | **Approved Rate Increase** | **Current Enrollment** | **Plans with 15%+ Rate Hikes** | **Plans on Marketplace** |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan | 11.2%[^1] | 149,136[^1] | 0[^1] | 0[^1] |
| Priority Health | 9.8%[^1] | 91,385[^1] | 0[^1] | 0[^1] |
| Blue Care Network of Michigan | 12.4%[^1] | 125,146[^1] | 13[^1] | 0[^1] |
| **Market Total** | **11.1%[^1]** | **412,125[^1]** | **39[^1]** | **0[^1]** |

Small group plans avoid marketplace complications and do not participate in federal exchange platforms, explaining the absence of plans offered "on marketplace" in this segment. The smaller approved increases for both BCBSM (11.2%) and Priority Health (9.8%) in this market reflect different risk characteristics and the absence of CSR (Cost Sharing Reduction) funding uncertainties that drive individual market volatility.[^1]

### Key Drivers of Rate Increases

Both carriers cited nearly identical actuarial factors in their 2026 filings:

- **Medical and pharmaceutical cost trends**: 5.8% for BCBSM[^2]
- **Morbidity adjustments due to expected disenrollment**: Carriers applied substantial adjustments (6.7% to 14% depending on scenario) reflecting anticipated attrition of healthier enrollees facing unsubsidized premium costs[^2]
- **Residual CSR funding uncertainty**: Although carriers filed assuming no federal Cost Sharing Reduction reimbursement, Silver plans on-exchange carried implicit 20.5% rate premiums to account for potential CSR non-funding[^2]


### ACA Marketplace Enrollment Impact from Tax Credit Expiration

The expiration of enhanced premium tax credits on December 31, 2025, produced measurable enrollment consequences in Michigan:


| **Metric** | **Value** | **Source** |
| :-- | :--: | :-- |
| Michigan ACA Enrollees (as of Jan 3, 2026) | 491,565[^3] | CMS/Michigan Public |
| 2025 Enrollment (same date) | 516,093[^3] | CMS |
| **Estimated Decline** | **~25,000[^3]** | Michigan Public (Jan 19, 2026) |
| **Alternative Estimate** | **~40,000[^4]** | Bridge Michigan (Jan 13, 2026) |
| Record 2025 Enrollment Peak | 531,083[^5] | HealthInsurance.org |
| 2026 Decline from 2025 Peak | ~40,000-50,000 | Implied from above |

The discrepancy between the 25,000 and 40,000 figures reflects different measurement dates and methodologies. The CMS data cited by Michigan Public represented enrollments through January 3, 2026, partway through the open enrollment period, while Bridge Michigan's January 13 figure captured enrollment through that date. Final 2026 enrollment figures through the January 15 federal deadline remain unavailable as of late January 2026, with CMS unlikely to publish complete data until summer 2026.[^6]

### Contextual Impact Analysis

The enrollment decline occurred against a backdrop of significant affordability deterioration. For a 40-year-old earning \$40,000 in Detroit, Michigan, benchmark silver plan premiums increased from \$78/month (2025) to \$128/month (2026)—a 64% gross increase. For a 60-year-old earning \$63,000, the increase was even more dramatic: from \$287/month to \$740/month, representing a 158% increase driven by the subsidy cliff effects.[^5]

Michigan declined to implement state-level premium backfill or Premium Alignment pricing policies that have been deployed in states like New Mexico (backfilling 100% of lost federal credits) and 14 states implementing Premium Alignment mechanisms. These policies have demonstrated the ability to offset enrollment declines significantly.[^7]

### Attribution of Rate Changes

DIFS issued 981 objections during its 2026 rate review process but approved all 20 submitted filings with no denials, processing filings within statutory timeframes (121-day average). The approved rates reflect regulatory acceptance of the carriers' actuarial assumptions regarding risk pool composition changes driven by tax credit expiration and CSR funding decisions.[^1]
