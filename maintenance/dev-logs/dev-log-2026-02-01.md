# Dev-Log: 2026-02-01 | Publishing Initial Skeleton

## The Objective
Initialize and publish the initial skeleton for `findyourdpc.com` to a private GitHub repository, ensuring all documentation and code align with the Scalable Project DNA (2026) and global workforce standards.

## The Struggle
- **Workflow Mid-Flight Adjustment**: The session began with a simple publication request, but required a pivot to adhere to the global `/publish` workflow standard, which introduced mandatory Code Review and Journaling steps.
- **Data Schema Inconsistency**: Reviewing `mi-clinics.json` revealed a high degree of variation in pricing models and clinic types. While the "SEO/GEO Content Boundary" forbids destructive pruning, this creates a logic challenge for the intended automated "HSA-Eligibility" badge verification.

## The Breakthrough
- **Documentation Alignment**: Successfully synthesized the "Project MISSION" from memory into `docs/PLAN.md` and updated `README.md` to serve as a high-trust entry point.
- **Strict Adherence**: Followed the global workflow to the letter, ensuring the repository is "agent-ready" and strictly follows 2026 standards before the first push.

## Time Audit
- **Planning & Research**: 0.5 hours (Workflow analysis, DNA extraction).
- **Execution (Docs & Review)**: 0.5 hours (README, PLAN.md, mi-clinics audit).
- **Total Deep Work**: ~1 hour.
