# Development Log - FindYourDPC Launch Session

**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Project:** FindYourDPC - Direct Primary Care Directory  
**Status:** MVP Ready for Production Launch

---

## The Objective

Build and polish a production-ready Direct Primary Care (DPC) directory website for Michigan. The goal was to create a functional MVP that allows patients to find DPC practices, and providers to claim their listings.

**Key Requirements:**
- Searchable directory of 70+ Michigan DPC practices
- Practice claiming system with Stripe payments ($50/month)
- Contact form with Resend email integration
- Responsive, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Provider portal for practice management

---

## The Struggle

### 1. **Geolocation & Search Complexity**
Implementing the 100-mile radius search was the most complex feature. The challenge was:
- No existing coordinates for practices
- Had to build a Michigan zip code geocoding database
- Calculate distances using Haversine formula
- Sort results by nearest to user

**Solution:** Created `src/utils/geocode.ts` with 300+ Michigan zip codes and distance calculation functions.

### 2. **Claim Workflow Integration**
The practice claiming flow required multiple moving parts:
- NPI verification API integration
- Email verification with 6-digit codes
- Stripe checkout session creation
- Webhook handling for subscription events
- JWT authentication for provider portal

**Solution:** Built a multi-step modal component with proper state management.

### 3. **Data Transformation**
The raw Michigan DPC data needed significant cleaning:
- Parsing physician names from various formats
- Extracting structured pricing information
- Generating SEO-friendly slugs
- Mapping practice types and specialties

**Solution:** Created `data/dataLoader.ts` with comprehensive data transformation logic.
